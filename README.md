# Commented
A music-focused project that allows users to provide commentary and justification for Spotify playlists. In the future, I plan to add features to allow collections of albums (which Spotify does not support), so users can create their own 'Top Albums' (for example) and tell the world what they think.

### Example
Heavily in-development.

(And a very broken dark mode)
